# OKRtool

a H5 tool for personal OKR(objective and key results method) making.

## idea

Recently, I read some books about OKR, so I want to make a convenient web tool for everyone to make their OKRs.

## implement

I use uni-app for h5 to make this tool for two days. Only one page named index.html.
